### Tasks (in dependency order)

- [ ] 001: <!-- Task description -->
  - AC: <!-- Acceptance criteria from story -->
  - Files: <!-- Files to create/modify -->
  - Verify: `<!-- command that exits 0 on success -->`
  - Risk: <!-- low | medium | high -->
  - Max iterations: 5
  - Wiring proof:
    - <!-- CLI command to test manually: e.g., python -m myapp command -->
    - <!-- Cross-module calls to assert: e.g., ModuleA.method() called by ModuleB -->

- [ ] 002: <!-- Task description -->
  - AC: <!-- Acceptance criteria from story -->
  - Files: <!-- Files to create/modify -->
  - Verify: `<!-- command that exits 0 on success -->`
  - Risk: <!-- low | medium | high -->
  - Max iterations: 8
  - Wiring proof:
    - <!-- CLI command to test manually -->
    - <!-- Cross-module calls to assert -->

<!-- Add more tasks as needed -->

### Verification Protocol
After each task, the verifier runs:
1. Task-specific verify command
2. Full regression test suite
3. Wiring proof checks (CLI boundary + import audit + pipeline completeness)
4. Manual CLI command execution

### Evidence Chain
Every task completion must include:
1. Commit hash (from `git rev-parse HEAD`)
2. Verify command output (test count + pass/fail)
3. Files created/modified (from `git diff --name-only`)
