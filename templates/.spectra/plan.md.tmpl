## Task 001: <!-- Task title -->
- [ ] 001: <!-- Task title -->
- AC:
  - <!-- Acceptance criterion from story -->
  - <!-- Additional criterion -->
- Files: <!-- comma-separated files to create/modify -->
- Verify: `<!-- command that exits 0 on success -->`
- Risk: low
- Max-iterations: 5
- Scope: code
- File-ownership:
  - owns: [<!-- files this task creates/modifies exclusively -->]
  - touches: [<!-- files this task modifies but shares -->]
  - reads: [<!-- files this task only reads -->]
- Wiring-proof:
  - CLI: <!-- exact command path to test manually -->
  - Integration: <!-- cross-module calls or pipeline assertions -->

## Parallelism Assessment
- Independent tasks: [none]
- Sequential dependencies: [001 -> 002]
- Recommendation: SEQUENTIAL_ONLY

### Verification Protocol
After each task, the verifier runs:
1. Task-specific verify command
2. Full regression test suite
3. Wiring-proof checks (CLI boundary + import audit + pipeline completeness)
4. Manual CLI command execution

### Evidence Chain
Every task completion must include:
1. Commit hash (from `git rev-parse HEAD`)
2. Verify command output (test count + pass/fail)
3. Files created/modified (from `git diff --name-only`)
