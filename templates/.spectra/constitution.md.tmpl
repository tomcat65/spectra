# Constitution — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> Generated by SPECTRA on {{DATE}} | Level {{LEVEL}}

## Project Principles

1. **Simplicity first** — Prefer the simplest solution that meets acceptance criteria.
2. **Tests prove correctness** — No feature is complete without passing tests.
3. **Small commits** — Each commit should be atomic and revertible.
4. **Convention over configuration** — Follow framework defaults unless there's a documented reason not to.
5. **Wiring over logic** — Proving modules connect correctly matters as much as proving they work in isolation.
6. **Evidence over assertions** — Every "done" claim requires a commit hash + test output.

## Tech Constraints

- Language: <!-- e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go -->
- Framework: <!-- e.g., Next.js 15, FastAPI, Gin -->
- Testing: <!-- e.g., Vitest, pytest, go test -->
- Style: <!-- e.g., Functional, minimal dependencies -->

## Coding Standards

- Use existing project conventions (linter, formatter, naming).
- No secrets in source code — use environment variables.
- All public APIs must have documentation or types.
- Error handling: fail fast with clean messages. No raw tracebacks at CLI boundaries.
- Every CLI command must have a catch-all exception handler producing clean error + exit 1.

## Verification Standards

- All tasks require independent verification before greenlight.
- Integration tests must exercise every pipeline step they claim to cover.
- CLI commands must be tested at the subprocess level, not just unit-tested.
- See `.spectra/guardrails.md` for learned Signs from past failures.

## Out of Scope

- <!-- List things explicitly excluded from this project -->

## Non-Negotiables

- No task proceeds without verification gate pass
- No "status theater" — evidence chain required for every completion
- Guardrails/Signs from past failures must be checked before committing
